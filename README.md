# arm_emu_v8a
It contains my attempt to emulate a arm v8-a architecture written in C++20 (incomplete as of this moment)

## Documentation and credits
This project is inspired by [cpp_box](https://github.com/lefticus/cpp_box/) and use the concepts of it as its bases.
It is only implementing AARCH64 on ARM v8-a CPUs based on the following documentations:
* https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0487/fc/
* https://developer.arm.com/architectures/learn-the-architecture/armv8-a-instruction-set-architecture

# Dependencies
To compile the application on Linux, please install libx11-dev, libxrandr-dev, libxinerama-dev, libxcursor-dev, libxi-dev, and OpenGL

# Getting started
This branch is used for re-working the project and might not be stable.

# Remarks
Thanks to [Jason Turner](https://github.com/lefticus/)'s talk that provoked me to pick a hard project to work on it. And his project *cpp_box* which I used as ground zero.
